Full Screen Video HTML, JS & CSS

This is a quick and simple but above all light method to have a full screen looped video, developed with little JS and CSS code.<br> 
You also have the possibility to add your signature in the footer and any external social link hidden in the footer itself, 
just scroll with the mouse.<br>
I uploaded an example video in mp4
